# Port Knocking
This project is for you to do port knocking for free. Existing apps are pretty ugly, so add your home screen and be happy.

## Building
With nodejs installed, run the commands below:

```bash
$ npm i
$ npm run build
```

When compiling, just serve the contents of `www/` on a WEB server, access and add the splash screen.

## Demo
